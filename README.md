# Perceiver - JAX (Flax)

Implementation of [Perceiver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03206) in JAX and Flax.
Also includes [ReZero](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04887) in lieu of LayerNorm, given its 
empirical benefits for very deep Transformers.

# Install

```shell
pip install perceiver-jax
```

Be sure to also install the correct accelerated jaxlib for your hardware.

# Usage

```python
import jax

from perceiver_jax import Perceiver

model = Perceiver(
    n_fourier_features=6,
    depth=8,
    n_latents=512,
    latent_n_heads=8,
    latent_head_features=64,
    cross_n_heads=2,
    cross_head_features=128,
    attn_dropout=0.,
    ff_mult=4,
    ff_dropout=0.,
)

RNG = jax.random.PRNGKey(42)
input_batch = jax.random.normal(RNG, (1, 224 * 224, 3))

y, variables = model.init_with_output({'params': RNG, 'dropout': RNG}, input_batch)
```

You'll notice the parametrization is slightly simpler than with PyTorch, as you can infer 
input feature dimension shapes in JAX.
